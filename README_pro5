Project no: 5

Project due date: December 8th, 2017

Project description: 

(1) Translating constructs from previous project, including int and float values, variables, print, assignment and the exressions

(2) Translating if/else and 6 relational operations: <, <=, ==, >, >=, !=

(3) Translating Bool value True and False

(4) Translating Basic Scope, nested functions and return statement

(5) Adequately test cases and mytest.py script to process all of them


The easiest part of this project: build ast while parsing

Problems that I had in completing this project:
(1) Modify pro4 to pro5 is tough, need a lot of work 
(2) Implement relational operation is hard because it contains recursion
(3) Translating nested function is hard, many grammers and features I am not fimilar with

PS. (1) Compatible with pro4, all testcases of pro4 passed
    (2) Add Bool and NULL type
    (3) Nested relational operations
    (4) No memeory leaks
    (5) More functions will be implement in pro6
